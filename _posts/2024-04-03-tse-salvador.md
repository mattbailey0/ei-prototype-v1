<div class="quote">
<p>I want to express our sincere interest and full support to the Voluntary Election Integrity Guidelines for Technology Companies. We deeply value this IFES initiative which promotes electoral integrity by enhancing cooperation among digital platforms and Elections Management Bodies around the world. In El Salvador we recognize the need to establish international standards that guarantee integrity and safety of our electoral processes, as we believe that an active participation by technology companies around this joint effort, is key to achieve a more robust and more threats resistant electoral system.</p>
