The Organization of American States (OAS) has issued a formal statement welcoming the launch of the Voluntary Election Integrity Guideliens for Technology Companies. The statement reads, in part:

<div class="quote">
<p>The General Secretariat of the Organization of American States (OAS) welcomes the launch of the Voluntary Election Integrity Guidelines for Technology Companies presented today by The International Foundation for Electoral Systems (IFES) which are the product of an effort between technology companies, electoral authorities, electoral experts and civil society organizations, which included the OAS General Secretariat.</p>

<p>The 11 guidelines seek to establish clear policies and processes to share information around elections and ensuring that voters have access to high-quality information, improve communication channels and collaboration between technology companies and electoral authorities, where applicable, and reduce barriers to supporting election integrity for smaller and newer businesses.</p>

<p>Recalling that in 2024 at least 12 electoral processes will be held in the Americas, the OAS Secretary General, Luis Almagro, highlighted that the guidelines are <i>“a step in the right direction and a starting point for the collaboration that must exist between governments, electoral authorities, civil society, academia and technology companies to promote electoral integrity, respond to current challenges and preserve freedom of expression and information and the political rights of citizens.”</i></p>
