<div class="quote">
<p>Today, as world leaders gather in the Democracy Summit in South Korea, the Commission on Elections takes this opportunity to formally endorse the Voluntary Election Integrity Guidelines for Technology Companies, which outlines the commitment of election stakeholders, most specially the technology companies, to ensure election integrity, improve the quality of election-related information disseminated and made available to voters, and implement best practices to combat widespread misinformation, disinformation, and mal-information.</p>

<p>The Commission on Elections is committed in harmonizing our policies and plans of action, particularly under our Digital Transformation Program and our Task Force Kontra (Against) Fake News, with these set of guidelines, to reflect our meaningful involvement in attaining the shared global vision of sustaining democracy and advancing electoral integrity, while maximizing the power of digitalization and technology in our election systems.</p>
