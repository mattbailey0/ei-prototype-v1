   text: "Managing the information environment in which an election is being delivered is critical to preserving the integrity of electoral processes, the integrity and reputation of the Electoral Management Body (EMB), and citizen’s trust in electoral outcomes. Much of this information environment is on various social media channels. The Australian Electoral Commission has been proactively engaging with social media companies for over 5 years, with a view to having a shared and collaborative approach with social media companies in helping to manage this critical information environment. We have had some good success but these Guidelines will be very useful in help to drive consistent standards across various social media channels. This is something that would benefit all EMBs around the world."
